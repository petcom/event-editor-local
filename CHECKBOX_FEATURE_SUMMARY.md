# Image Upload to S3 Checkbox Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a new "Images Uploaded to S3" checkbox feature that allows users to track and control which events need their images synced to S3. This provides better manual control and more accurate sync operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. **UI Updates**

**HTML Changes (`index.html`)**:
- Added checkbox in Step 2 (Event Details) form: `<input type="checkbox" id="images_uploaded_to_s3" />`
- Added CSS styling for checkbox with proper alignment and accessibility

**CSS Changes (`inc/css/index.css`)**:
- Added `.checkbox-label` styling for proper checkbox appearance
- Updated form group layout to accommodate the new checkbox
- Made checkbox larger and more accessible

### 2. **Data Structure Updates**

**Events Data (`events.js`)**:
- Added `images_uploaded_to_s3: boolean` field to event objects
- Updated `saveEvent()` to include checkbox state: `images_uploaded_to_s3: document.getElementById('images_uploaded_to_s3').checked`
- Updated `addNewEvent()` to initialize new events with `images_uploaded_to_s3: false`

### 3. **Form Management Updates**

**UI Functions (`ui.js`)**:
- Updated `clearFormWithId()` to reset checkbox to unchecked state
- Updated `loadEventToForm()` to set checkbox based on event data: `checkbox.checked = evt.images_uploaded_to_s3 || false`

### 4. **Sync Logic Updates**

**Upload Handler (`uploads.js`)**:
- Modified `syncAllImagesToS3()` to **only process events where `images_uploaded_to_s3` is `false`**
- Automatically sets `images_uploaded_to_s3 = true` when sync is successful
- Updated `handleImageUpload()` to reset checkbox to `false` when new local images are added

### 5. **Workflow Management Updates**

**Workflow Manager (`workflow.js`)**:
- Updated `checkStep4()` to use `currentEvent.images_uploaded_to_s3` instead of URL pattern matching
- Updated `canMergeToServer()` to check `images_uploaded_to_s3` flag instead of local path patterns
- Events with images must have `images_uploaded_to_s3: true` before server merge is allowed

### 6. **User Experience Improvements**

**Smart Behavior**:
- When user selects new images → checkbox automatically unchecks (needs re-sync)
- When S3 sync succeeds → checkbox automatically checks (sync complete)
- User can manually check/uncheck to override automatic behavior
- Merge to server is blocked if any events with images have unchecked boxes

## How It Works

### **Workflow Flow**:
1. **Create Event** → `images_uploaded_to_s3: false`
2. **Add Images** → Checkbox unchecked (local images need sync)
3. **Sync to S3** → Only processes unchecked events → Auto-checks on success
4. **Merge to Server** → Only allowed if all events with images are checked

### **Manual Control**:
- Users can uncheck the box to force re-sync of an event
- Users can check the box to skip sync (if they know images are already uploaded)
- Clear visual indicator of sync status

### **Validation**:
- Server merge blocked with clear message if any events have unchecked images
- Sync operation only processes events that actually need syncing
- No wasted API calls on already-synced events

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Only syncs events that actually need it
2. **Manual Control**: Users can override automatic detection
3. **Clear Status**: Visual indication of which events are synced
4. **Better UX**: Prevents invalid operations with helpful messages
5. **Reliability**: More accurate tracking than URL pattern matching

## Files Modified

### New Fields Added:
- `images_uploaded_to_s3` (boolean) in event objects

### Files Changed:
- `index.html` - Added checkbox UI
- `inc/css/index.css` - Added checkbox styling
- `renderer/events.js` - Updated save/add functions
- `renderer/ui.js` - Updated form management
- `renderer/uploads.js` - Updated sync logic
- `renderer/workflow.js` - Updated workflow validation
- `renderer/index.js` - Updated validation messages

## Testing

The feature has been implemented and the application starts successfully. Users can now:
- ✅ See checkbox in event details form
- ✅ Control which events get synced to S3
- ✅ Get blocked from server merge if images aren't uploaded
- ✅ Have automatic checkbox management during sync operations

The implementation provides both automatic smart behavior and manual user control over the image sync process.
